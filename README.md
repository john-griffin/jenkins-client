# Jenkins::Client [![travis](https://secure.travis-ci.org/john-griffin/jenkins-client.png)](http://travis-ci.org/john-griffin/jenkins-client) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/john-griffin/jenkins-client.png)](https://gemnasium.com/john-griffin/jenkins-client)

This is a small gem used for listing, finding and creating Jenkins jobs on a Jenkins CI server.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'jenkins-client'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jenkins-client

## Usage

In rails add an initialiser like this

``` ruby
client = Jenkins::Client.new
client.username = "user"
client.password = "pass"
client.url = "http://jenkinsurl.com"
```

Then you can issue the following commands in your app.

### Jobs

`client.jobs` returns a hash of jobs with the job name as key.

#### Create

Create a new Jenkins job on the server with a given configuration.

``` ruby
job = Jenkins::Client::Job.new({name: "job_name"})
job.create!(config)
```

Jenkins uses XML config files on the server and this is what you should send as the config. Example:

``` xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<project>
  <actions/>
  <description></description>
  <keepDependencies>false</keepDependencies>
  <properties/>
  <scm class="hudson.scm.NullSCM"/>
  <canRoam>true</canRoam>
  <disabled>false</disabled>
  <blockBuildWhenDownstreamBuilding>false</blockBuildWhenDownstreamBuilding>
  <blockBuildWhenUpstreamBuilding>false</blockBuildWhenUpstreamBuilding>
  <triggers class="vector"/>
  <concurrentBuild>false</concurrentBuild>
  <builders/>
  <publishers/>
  <buildWrappers/>
</project>
```

To export an existing config simply look in the jobs path inside your Jenkins server and pull back a job's `config.xml` file.

#### Start

Starts a job.

job = Jenkins::Client::Job.new({name: "job_name"})
job.start!

#### Delete

Delete a Jenkins job on the server.

``` ruby
job = Jenkins::Client::Job.new({name: "job_name"})
job.delete!
```

#### Last Build

`job.last_build` will return the last build.
`job.last_successful_build` will return the last successful build.
`job.last_failed_build` will return the last failed build.

### Build

`build.console_text` will return the build's console text.
